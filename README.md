# Toxicity-Discord-Bot

This is a fun discord bot that I made. To call the bot, use "!toxic_bot " followed by your message. The bot will print out a "toxicity percentage." The higher the percentage, the more toxic your message is. A great tool for server moderation! The actual AI was trained by Google. This is Perspective AI, an API that uses machine learning to identify toxicity. All credits go to Perspective AI.
